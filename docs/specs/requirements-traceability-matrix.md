# LCSP Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Purpose

Canonical traceability from use cases to requirements, acceptance criteria, domain/state specifications, and implementation areas.

## Inventory

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Canonical use cases | UC-001..UC-017; historical UC-018 superseded |
| Functional requirements | 56 total; Phase 5.2L: `FR-050` active Automatic Trusted Scan Initiation; `FR-051` removed; `FR-052` deferred; `FR-045/FR-046` superseded |
| Active NFRs | 33 |
| Acceptance criteria | AC-001..AC-041 plus AC-050A..AC-050F |
| UX | UX_ARTIFACT_REMOVED_FROM_ACTIVE_DOC_SET / UX_REBASE_PENDING_AFTER_DOC_PRUNING |
| Stories | missing; story coverage not assessable |

Legacy `UC-MXX-XX`, `FR-E*`, `FR-057..FR-082`, `NFR-031`, and `NFR-032` are aliases/history only. Active rows below use canonical identifiers.

## UX and Story Boundary

UX must be rebased or regenerated from the pruned active authority set and then reviewed/approved. Story coverage remains not assessable until canonical epics/stories exist. Stories must trace to UC, FR, AC, relevant NFRs, UX states, domain states, implementation area, and recovery behavior.
