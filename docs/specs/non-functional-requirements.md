# LCSP Non-Functional Requirements

## Purpose

This document is the canonical active non-functional requirements catalog for LCSP after Phase 5.2L. It normalizes active and recovered legacy NFRs into a single `NFR-001` sequence and removes unresolved auth/account/security gaps by classifying them as platform baseline requirements.

Phase 5.2L authorization rule:

- PBAC is the authorization source of truth.
- Roles may remain only as subject attributes, grouping labels, or policy templates.
- Roles/RBAC must not be the final authorization authority.
- Every authorization decision must be tenant-scoped, deny-by-default, server-side enforced, versioned, auditable, and traceable to policy ID/version plus correlation ID.

## NFR Catalog

Active NFR inventory contains exactly `NFR-001..NFR-030` and `NFR-033..NFR-035`.

`NFR-031` and `NFR-032` are legacy identifiers only. They are not active catalog rows and must not be counted as active NFRs. Their recovered meanings are preserved in the legacy mapping:

- Legacy `NFR-031` maps to active `NFR-005` for OAuth identity-linking safety.
- Legacy `NFR-032` maps to active `NFR-008` for Manager super-role enforcement.

Do not renumber active NFRs in this remediation.

| ID | Category | Statement | Measurement | Verification Method | Applies To | Priority |

| NFR-020 | Compliance Support | Generated reports must not overclaim evidence, legal certainty, validation, certification or production readiness. | Final report blocked/degraded when prerequisites fail; no compliance certification wording. | Document generation tests/review. | Document Generation | Must |
| NFR-021 | Reliability | Long-running scan, legal matching, classification and document work must not depend on web request lifecycle. | Job status and failure reason persist after request completion. | Queue/job tests. | Scanner, Legal Matching, Classification, Document | Must |
