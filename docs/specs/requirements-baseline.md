# Requirements Baseline

## Purpose

This document recovers the active requirements baseline from existing active documents and archived delete-candidate requirements. It does not create new requirements.

## Governance

- This document is authoritative for the recovered UC inventory, FR crosswalk, and NFR crosswalk.
- Canonical active FR namespace: `FR-001...` from `docs/specs/functional-requirements.md`.
- Canonical active NFR namespace: `NFR-001...` from `docs/specs/non-functional-requirements.md`.
- PRD `FR-E*` and `NFR-1..NFR-14` IDs are source aliases only. They are not active implementation requirement IDs after Phase 5.9 normalization.
- Legacy IDs remain traceability aliases recovered from archived requirement catalogs.
- Canonical FR inventory contains 56 total FRs. Phase 5.2L active MVP FRs are `FR-001..FR-044`, `FR-047..FR-050`, and `FR-053..FR-056`; `FR-045/FR-046` are `SUPERSEDED_FOR_ACTIVE_MVP`, `FR-051` is `REMOVED_FROM_PRODUCT`, and `FR-052` is `DEFERRED_POST_MVP`.
- Canonical active NFR inventory contains 33 active NFRs: `NFR-001..NFR-030` and `NFR-033..NFR-035`.
- `NFR-031` and `NFR-032` are legacy identifiers only, not active NFR catalog rows.
- `PLATFORM_BASELINE` means the active normalized requirement belongs to the platform baseline even when no one-to-one PRD source alias exists.
- Archived requirement catalogs remain archived and are not active source-of-truth documents.

## Active Canonical Sources

- `docs/product/prd.md`
- `docs/product/business-rules.md`

## Historical Recovery Inputs

These archived documents were used only to recover legacy IDs and traceability aliases. They are not active implementation or requirements authority.

## PRD FR Source Alias Inventory

The following `FR-E*` identifiers are retained only as PRD/source aliases. Active implementation requirements use the `FR-001...` namespace in `docs/specs/functional-requirements.md`.

### Deferred Evidence Source Aliases

| PRD Alias | Active Canonical Requirement | MVP Scope Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-E3-2 | FR-050 | SUPERSEDED_FOR_ACTIVE_MVP | Local/CI scanner report upload is superseded. `FR-050` now means Automatic Trusted Scan Initiation. |
| FR-E3-3 | FR-051 | REMOVED_FROM_PRODUCT | Manual technical evidence JSON upload is removed from active scope, roadmap, future scope, UX, APIs, entities, stories and delivery plans. |

The active controlled MVP technical-evidence path is GitHub App repository connection, snapshot creation and Repository Scan.

## PRD NFR Source Alias Inventory

The following PRD `NFR-*` identifiers are retained only as PRD/source aliases. Active implementation NFRs use the `NFR-001...` namespace in `docs/specs/non-functional-requirements.md`.

| Canonical NFR | Statement | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NFR-1 | Raw source code must not be sent to LLM. | docs/product/prd.md |
| NFR-2 | Raw source code must not be stored long term. | docs/product/prd.md |
| NFR-3 | GitHub App access must be read-only and limited to selected repositories for MVP default path. | docs/product/prd.md |
| NFR-4 | Technical findings shown to Manager must avoid unnecessary source/code exposure. | docs/product/prd.md |
| NFR-5 | Secrets must be redacted before any evidence snippet or summary is stored. | docs/product/prd.md |
| NFR-6 | Risk classification must be repeatable for the same VerifiedProfile, legal corpus/rule version and evidence version. | docs/product/prd.md |
| NFR-7 | Every final report must be traceable to assessment, evidence, rules, conflict resolutions and document version. | docs/product/prd.md |
| NFR-8 | Legal corpus/rule version used for classification must be recorded. | docs/product/prd.md |
| NFR-9 | System must fail closed for missing critical evidence, missing legal trace or unresolved material conflict. | docs/product/prd.md |
| NFR-10 | Manager-facing language must avoid technical implementation terms unless accompanied by plain-language explanation. | docs/product/prd.md |
| NFR-11 | Developer-facing tasks must include enough assessment context to act without exposing unnecessary business data. | docs/product/prd.md |
| NFR-12 | Evidence statuses must be understandable to both Manager and Developer. | docs/product/prd.md |
| NFR-13 | MVP UI copy and documents should support Vietnamese as primary language. | docs/product/prd.md |
| NFR-14 | Web UI should target common accessibility expectations for forms, status messages and document review. | docs/product/prd.md |

## Legacy NFR Alias Mapping

These identifiers are retained only for traceability drift cleanup. They are not active NFR inventory rows.

| Legacy Identifier | Active NFR | Meaning | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NFR-031 | NFR-005 | OAuth identity linking safety | archived non-functional-requirements.md; active PRD |
| NFR-032 | NFR-008 | Manager super-role enforcement | archived non-functional-requirements.md; active PRD |

## Acceptance Criteria Inventory

| AC | Statement | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AC-1 | A Wizard-only assessment never displays HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-2 | Risk Classification Agent cannot run before VerifiedProfile exists. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-3 | Technical evidence must pass schema completeness gate before reconciliation. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-4 | Technical evidence must pass quality threshold gate before classification unlock. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-5 | Any unresolved conflict blocks final classification/report until resolved. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-6 | Manager conflict resolution is required and sufficient for MVP conflict completion when evidence gates pass. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-7 | Evidence Confidence Score and AI Intervention Score never block workflow alone. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-8 | Conflict handling uses binary MVP routing: conflict exists or not. Conflict Score may explain seriousness but does not create multiple routes. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-9 | Human assertion, role label, delegated scope or untrusted upload cannot replace machine-generated metadata listed in A3. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-10 | Final report includes legal citation/rule trace or is not final. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-11 | Final report has no attestation dependency and discloses evidence, legal basis, PBAC/trigger trace and limitations. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-12 | Audit trail records wizard, evidence, conflict, PBAC/trigger, classification and document generation events. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-13 | PRD preserves all mandatory product decisions from Product Brief. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-14 | PRD contains section for high-risk assumptions and validation requirements. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-15 | PRD does not define architecture, backlog or code. | docs/product/prd.md |
| AC-16 | PRD is clear enough for Architect Agent to identify product constraints and unresolved assumptions. | docs/product/prd.md |

## Recovery Verification

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active canonical FR crosswalk matches `docs/specs/functional-requirements.md` | PASS | `FR-001..FR-056`; no active `FR-057..FR-082` rows remain in this crosswalk. |
| All active BR legacy NFR references listed | PASS | 29 unique legacy NFR refs recovered |
| Unmapped legacy FR IDs | PASS | None |
| Unmapped legacy NFR IDs | PASS | None |
| Platform-baseline FR IDs without one-to-one PRD source alias | RESOLVED_PLATFORM_BASELINE | FR-001, FR-002, FR-003, FR-004, FR-005, FR-006, FR-007, FR-008, FR-009 |

## Canonical Count Assertions

| Assertion | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Total canonical FRs | 56 |
| Active MVP FRs | 53 |
| Deferred FRs | 3 |
| Active NFRs | 33 |
| Legacy-only NFR identifiers | NFR-031, NFR-032 |

`FR-E*` values are source aliases only. `NFR-031` and `NFR-032` may appear only as legacy aliases/mappings and must not be counted as active NFR inventory.
