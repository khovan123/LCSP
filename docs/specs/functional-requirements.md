# LCSP Functional Requirements

## Governance

Canonical IDs are `FR-001..FR-056`. Phase 5.2L supersedes the previous active/deferred split:

- `FR-045` and `FR-046` structured attestation semantics are `SUPERSEDED_FOR_ACTIVE_MVP`.
- `FR-050` is redefined as `AUTOMATIC_TRUSTED_SCAN_INITIATION`.
- `FR-051` manual technical evidence JSON upload is `REMOVED_FROM_PRODUCT`.
- `FR-052` delegated free-form clarification remains inactive and is `DEFERRED_POST_MVP` unless separately approved.
- Legacy `FR-E*` and `FR-057..FR-082` values are source aliases only.

PBAC is the authorization source of truth for every active requirement. Role labels may appear only as subject attributes, grouping labels, or policy templates.
