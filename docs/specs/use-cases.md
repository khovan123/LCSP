# LCSP Use Cases

## Purpose

Canonical active use-case catalog for the A-to-Z runnable MVP. Detailed user interaction sequences live in `user-task-flows.md`.

## Governance

- Canonical active IDs are `UC-001..UC-017`; legacy `UC-018` structured attestation is `SUPERSEDED_FOR_ACTIVE_MVP`.
- Legacy `UC-MXX-XX` values may remain only in `requirements-baseline.md` and the explicitly labeled source-alias columns of `business-rules.md`; they are not active traceability IDs.
- Canonical FRs are `FR-001..FR-056`; `FR-050` is `AUTOMATIC_TRUSTED_SCAN_INITIATION`, `FR-051` is `REMOVED_FROM_PRODUCT`, and `FR-052` is `DEFERRED_POST_MVP`.
- Manager completes the golden path without Developer participation.
- Structured attestation under historical `FR-045/FR-046` is removed from active MVP.
- Delegated free-form clarification under `FR-052` is Deferred.
- PBAC is the authorization source of truth. Role labels are not final authorization authority.
- Internal legal corpus operations are API/CLI-only for MVP, not Manager/Developer product UX.

## UC-001 Authenticate and Manage Account

Goal: establish a safe organization-scoped session through approved password/MFA or OAuth/OIDC paths. Invalid identity, callback, MFA, session, or rate-limit state is denied safely and audited. OAuth identity does not grant repository access.

## UC-002 Manage Organization and Roles

Goal: maintain tenant membership, PBAC policy scope, Manager accountability, and optional scoped Developer collaboration. Cross-tenant actions, revoked policy scope, and Developer attempts at Manager-only actions are denied by server-side PBAC.

## UC-003 Create Assessment

Goal: create a Manager-owned Assessment in the organization and record the action. Missing organization or Manager authority blocks creation.

## UC-004 Complete WizardProfile and Readiness

Goal: capture purpose, sector, data, affected people, decision role, oversight, and external LLM usage in business language. Wizard-only output shows readiness gaps and never a risk level.

## UC-005 Connect Repository

Goal: connect a selected read-only GitHub repository through GitHub App. The system validates installation/repository scope separately from LCSP login.

## UC-006 Create Repository Snapshot

Goal: pin repository evidence to an immutable branch/commit snapshot. Inaccessible commits or invalid scope block snapshot creation.

## UC-007 Execute Repository Scan

Goal: convert the snapshot into static technical evidence through the Python Scanner Worker. The worker runs the approved scanner toolchain, including Syft, Knip, deptry, Python `ast`/`libcst`, bounded `ts-morph`, tree-sitter/custom parser, and Semgrep custom rules, persists metadata-only evidence, verifies cleanup, and emits completed or failed event.

## UC-008 Generate TechnicalProfile

Goal: aggregate an accepted TechnicalEvidenceReport into evidence-backed technical dimensions or explicit unknowns. Invalid or insufficient reports block profile creation.

## UC-009 Generate AIUsageFlow

Goal: combine WizardProfile, TechnicalProfile, findings, and evidence refs into claim-level usage facts with confidence and uncertainty. Provider-only evidence cannot confirm active use.

## UC-010 Resolve Conflict

Goal: let Manager resolve material mismatch while preserving scanner evidence. Structured attestation is not active MVP input. Free-form delegated clarification under `FR-052` is not active.

## UC-011 Create and Approve VerifiedProfile

Goal: produce the reconciled basis for legal matching after all material conflicts are absent or Manager-resolved. Open conflict blocks the profile.

## UC-012 Operate Legal Corpus and Perform Legal Matching

Goal: prepare an approved immutable legal corpus and match VerifiedProfile facts to citation-backed rules. Source validation, ingestion, review, approval, and index build are Internal Legal Operator API/CLI operations. Manager/Developer UX only sees assessment-relevant corpus version and citations.

## UC-013 Run Risk Classification

Goal: create a cited risk result or explicit blocked state after VerifiedProfile and LegalRuleMatch. The acceptance run uses a real configured provider; missing citation, provider failure, invalid output, or unknown critical usage fails closed.

## UC-014 Generate Gap Analysis and Documents

Goal: derive compliance gaps and create a guarded final document. Readiness-only export may exist earlier without risk level. Missing classification, gap, citation, or conflict prerequisite blocks final output.

## UC-015 Review and Export Audit Trail

Goal: let Manager inspect and export redacted actor/action/object/time/version/correlation records across the assessment. Sensitive runtime content is excluded.

## UC-016 Re-run Assessment Evidence

Goal: create or resume a scan/evidence chain from trusted integration context without mutating history. Local/CI scanner report upload is superseded by `FR-050` automatic trusted scan initiation. Manual evidence JSON upload is removed from product scope.

## UC-017 Enforce Security and Privacy Controls

Goal: enforce source non-execution, restricted workspace, cleanup, redaction, no raw source to LLM, metadata-only persistence, and auditable fail-closed behavior.

## UX Boundary

`bmad-ux` designs Manager and optional Developer experiences for UC-001..UC-017, excluding the internal operations portion of UC-012. It must cover loading, empty, insufficient, permission-denied, blocked, failed, retry/rerun, degraded, automatic trigger mapping states, and audit-reference states. It must not create active screens for manual scanner report upload, `FR-051`, `FR-052`, structured attestation, or customer-facing corpus administration.
