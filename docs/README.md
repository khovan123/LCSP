# LCSP Documentation Start Here

## Purpose

This is the starting point for developers, reviewers, UX, and story planning. Active documents describe the A-to-Z runnable MVP after Phase 5.2L correction, not production deployment, customer onboarding, legal certification, formal legal opinion, regulator submission, or completed implementation readiness.

## Current Planning Status

## Required Reading Order

1. [product/system-context.md](./product/system-context.md)
2. [product/product-brief.md](./product/product-brief.md)
3. [product/prd.md](./product/prd.md)
4. [product/business-rules.md](./product/business-rules.md)
5. [specs/use-cases.md](./specs/use-cases.md)
6. [specs/functional-requirements.md](./specs/functional-requirements.md)
7. [specs/non-functional-requirements.md](./specs/non-functional-requirements.md)
8. [specs/acceptance-criteria-catalog.md](./specs/acceptance-criteria-catalog.md)
9. [architecture/architecture.md](./architecture/architecture.md)
10. [architecture/adr/architecture-decision-records.md](./architecture/adr/architecture-decision-records.md)
11. [implementation/README.md](./implementation/README.md)
12. [docs-vn/README.md](../docs-vn/README.md)

UX review should focus on product, use cases, FR/NFR, acceptance criteria, domain specs and ADR constraints. Engineering work additionally reads architecture and implementation docs after implementation readiness is certified.

## Single Sources of Truth

| Concern | Authoritative Document |
|---|---|
| Product scope and actors | `product/system-context.md`, `product/product-brief.md`, `product/prd.md` |
| Business rules | `product/business-rules.md` |
| Canonical requirements | `specs/functional-requirements.md`, `specs/non-functional-requirements.md` |
| Use cases and user flows | `specs/use-cases.md`, `specs/user-task-flows.md` |
| Acceptance criteria | `specs/acceptance-criteria-catalog.md` |
| Traceability | `specs/requirements-traceability-summary.md`, `specs/requirements-traceability-matrix.md` |
| System components | `architecture/architecture.md`, active ADRs |
| End-to-end runtime | `specs/domain-state-machines.md`, `specs/event-catalog.md`, `implementation/` |
| Assessment lifecycle | `specs/assessment-lifecycle-spec.md` |
| Scanner behavior | `specs/scanner-spec.md` |
| Scanner runtime | `implementation/scanner-implementation.md`, `implementation/scanner-worker-implementation.md` |
| Build details | `implementation/` |
| Physical persistence | `implementation/persistence-implementation.md` |
| Queues/outbox | `implementation/queue-implementation.md` |

## Documentation Layers

```text
product/                        product purpose, actors, business rules
specs/                          canonical behavior and requirements
architecture/                   components and decisions
implementation/                 build/configuration specifications
docs-vn/                        Vietnamese summary and review notes
```

Historical material remains available through git history, not as active documentation authority.

## Active MVP Runtime Shape

```text
apps/api                 NestJS API synchronous control plane
apps/web                 Manager and optional Developer web UX
lcsp-python-workers      bounded Python Worker Platform for all async domain workloads
tools/ts-js-analyzer     bounded Node.js CLI used only by Python Scanner Worker
PostgreSQL + ChromaDB legal index
RabbitMQ
S3-compatible object storage
real LLM provider for A-to-Z acceptance
```

Node.js downstream domain workers are `SUPERSEDED_FOR_ACTIVE_MVP`. Node.js remains valid for the NestJS API, web/tooling, and the bounded `ts-morph` analyzer CLI only.

## Phase 5.2L Locked Corrections

- PBAC is the authorization source of truth. Roles may remain only as subject attributes, grouping labels, or policy templates; roles are not the final authorization authority.
- Structured attestation is `SUPERSEDED_FOR_ACTIVE_MVP` and removed from active MVP use cases, requirements, UX, entities, events, audit/report dependencies, and delivery tasks.
- Compliance certification, formal legal opinion, direct regulator submission, and `FR-051` manual technical evidence JSON upload are `REMOVED_FROM_PRODUCT`.
- `FR-050` no longer means Local/CI scanner report upload. It is redefined as `AUTOMATIC_TRUSTED_SCAN_INITIATION`.
- All asynchronous domain workloads belong to the Python Worker Platform.
- Scanner toolchain includes Syft, Knip, deptry, Semgrep custom rules, tree-sitter/custom parser, Python `ast` + `libcst`, and bounded `ts-morph`.

## Scanner Ownership

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Trusted scan trigger/job query | NestJS API synchronous control plane |
| Scan lifecycle | Python Scanner Worker |
| Python AST/CST | Python Scanner Worker |
| SBOM/dependency inventory | Python Scanner Worker invoking Syft |
| JS/TS dependency usage | Python Scanner Worker invoking Knip |
| Python dependency usage | Python Scanner Worker invoking deptry |
| AI pattern rules | Python Scanner Worker invoking Semgrep custom rules |
| Cross-language structural augmentation | Python Scanner Worker using tree-sitter/custom parser |
| TS/JS semantic analysis | Node CLI subprocess controlled by Python Scanner Worker |
| Findings/taxonomy | `specs/scanner-spec.md` |
| Runtime object journey | `specs/domain-state-machines.md`, `implementation/scanner-worker-implementation.md` |
| Persistence/queues | implementation docs |

## Legal Corpus UX Boundary

Corpus ingestion, review, approval, and index build are internal operations/API/CLI for MVP. `bmad-ux` designs Manager and optional Developer product experiences; it does not create customer-facing corpus administration screens.

## Planned Local Development Commands

These commands are contracts for the future implementation and are not evidence that code already exists:

```text
# infrastructure and Node services
npm install
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev:api
npm run dev:web

# Python Worker Platform
cd lcsp-python-workers
poetry install
poetry run pytest
poetry run python -m lcsp_workers.scanner.main

# TS/JS analyzer
cd ../tools/ts-js-analyzer
npm install
npm run build
npm test

# integrated validation after implementation
npm run test
npm run smoke:a-to-z
```

An A-to-Z acceptance run additionally requires:

- real PostgreSQL/RabbitMQ;
- real S3-compatible object storage;
- validated official legal source snapshots and approved corpus version;
- completed ChromaDB vectorless legal index;
- configured real LLM provider/model;
- golden repository fixture;
- audit/export verification.

## Ready-to-Code Rule

Coding begins only after canonical UX and epics/stories exist and `bmad-check-implementation-readiness` certifies the remediated set. Until then:

```text
IMPLEMENTATION_NOT_AUTHORIZED
SPRINT_EXECUTION_NOT_AUTHORIZED
```
