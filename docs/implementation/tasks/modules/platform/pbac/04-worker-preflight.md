# PBAC Worker Preflight — Python Worker Authorization Check

## Outcome

Before a Python worker processes any task-queue message that requires authorization context, it calls back to the NestJS API via a preflight endpoint to verify the authorization decision is still valid. This prevents stale-membership exploitation: a Developer whose membership was revoked after task dispatch must not have their task executed.

## Module Files

**NestJS API side:**

| File | Action | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/api/src/platform/pbac/pbac-preflight.controller.ts` | Create | `POST /internal/pbac/preflight` |
| `apps/api/src/platform/pbac/pbac-preflight.service.ts` | Create | Re-evaluates PBAC for worker context |
| `apps/api/src/platform/pbac/pbac.module.ts` | Modify | Register preflight controller |

**Python Worker side (specification only — implemented in python-workers tasks):**

| Pattern | Notes |
|---|---|
| Before processing: POST `/internal/pbac/preflight` | Pass `userId`, `orgId`, `action`, `correlationId` |
| If response `decision = deny` → discard message, emit `WORKER_TASK_DENIED` event | Do not process |
| If response `decision = allow` → process task | Continue |

## API Contract

**Endpoint:** `POST /internal/pbac/preflight`
**Auth:** Internal worker API key (not session-based — workers are server-side)

**Request body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `user_id` | string | Yes | The user on whose behalf the task runs |
| `organization_id` | string | Yes | |
| `action` | string | Yes | The specific action the worker will perform |
| `correlation_id` | string | Yes | Task correlation ID |

**Success response (200):**

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `decision` | `allow` \| `deny` | |
| `reason_code` | string \| null | Only on deny |
| `correlation_id` | string | |

## Business Rules

1. Endpoint is authenticated via `X-Worker-Api-Key` header (pre-shared secret from env var `WORKER_API_KEY`).
2. Evaluation is a full PBAC re-evaluation: load membership + policy + call evaluator. Same rules as NestJS guard.
3. `decision = deny` is returned for revoked membership, expired policy, or action not granted. Never 4xx for policy denial — always 200 with `decision = deny`.
4. Python worker must discard the task message if `decision = deny`. Task must not be retried — log `WORKER_TASK_DENIED` event.
5. If preflight endpoint is unreachable: worker fails the task (no silent allow). Retry after backoff.
6. `AuthDecisionLog` written for all preflight decisions (allow and deny).

## Prisma Models Used

| Model | Action | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `AuthMembership` | Read | `(userId, orgId, status = active)` |
| `AuthPolicy` | Read | From membership |
| `AuthDecisionLog` | Create | `decision`, `reasonCode`, `action`, `userId`, `orgId`, `policyId`, `policyVersion` |

## Test Cases

| ID | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| T01 | Valid membership + action granted | 200 `decision: allow` |
| T02 | Membership revoked since task dispatch | 200 `decision: deny`, `reason: STATE_GATE_FAILED` |
| T03 | Action not in policy | 200 `decision: deny`, `reason: ACTION_NOT_GRANTED` |
| T04 | Missing/invalid `X-Worker-Api-Key` | 401 |
| T05 | Worker discards task on deny | No processing — logged as `WORKER_TASK_DENIED` |
| T06 | Preflight unreachable — worker behavior | Worker fails task, does not process |
| T07 | `AuthDecisionLog` written for allow | DB row exists |
| T08 | `AuthDecisionLog` written for deny | DB row exists |

## Definition of Done

- Preflight endpoint secured by `X-Worker-Api-Key`.
- Always returns 200 with `decision: allow | deny` (4xx only for auth failure or bad request).
- `AuthDecisionLog` written for all decisions.
- Python worker integration spec documented (implemented in python-workers tasks).
- Revoked-membership deny verified end-to-end in integration test.
