# Get Workspace Endpoint

## Outcome

Return the authenticated Manager's active organization workspace context — membership details, granted PBAC actions, and current session state — without leaking policy internals.

## Module Files

| File | Action | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/api/src/modules/auth-workspace/presentation/http/auth-workspace.controller.ts` | Verify | `GET /workspace` exists |
| `apps/api/src/modules/auth-workspace/application/queries/get-workspace/get-workspace.query.ts` | Verify | Query shape |
| `apps/api/src/modules/auth-workspace/application/queries/get-workspace/get-workspace.handler.ts` | Verify | Projection logic |
| `apps/api/src/modules/auth-workspace/application/contracts/auth-workspace/workspace.contract.ts` | Verify | `WorkspaceRequest` + response DTO |

## API Contract

**Endpoint:** `GET /workspace`
**Auth required:** Yes — valid session token (MFA-verified if MFA enrolled)

**Query parameters:**

| Param | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `organization_id` | string | Yes | Target organization scope |
| `session_token` | string | Yes | (Should move to Authorization header in future) |

**Success response (200):**

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `organization_id` | string | |
| `organization_name` | string | |
| `user_id` | string | |
| `display_name` | string | |
| `membership_status` | string | `active` only returned here |
| `subject_role` | string | From `AuthMembership.subjectAttributes.role` |
| `granted_actions` | string[] | Actions allowed by PBAC policy for this user+org |
| `session_expires_at` | string | ISO 8601 |
| `mfa_verified` | boolean | Whether `session.mfaVerifiedAt` is set |
| `correlation_id` | string | |

**Error responses:**

| HTTP | `error_code` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 401 | `SESSION_INVALID` | Token invalid, expired, or revoked |
| 401 | `MFA_REQUIRED` | MFA enrolled but not yet verified on this session |
| 403 | `MEMBERSHIP_MISSING` | No active membership in requested org |
| 403 | `ORG_SCOPE_MISMATCH` | Session org ≠ requested org |

## Prisma Models Used

| Model | Action | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `AuthSession` | Read | Validate token, check `mfaVerifiedAt` |
| `AuthMembership` | Read | `userId`, `organizationId`, `status`, `subjectAttributes`, `policyId`, `policyVersion` |
| `AuthOrganization` | Read | `id`, `name` |
| `AuthPolicy` | Read | `id`, `version`, `actions`, `subjectRole`, `stateGate` |
| `AuthUser` | Read | `id`, `displayName` |

## Business Rules

1. Validate session token (fingerprint + hash + expiry + revoked check).
2. If `AuthUserMfa` exists for user AND `session.mfaVerifiedAt = null` → `MFA_REQUIRED`.
3. Verify `session.organizationId == organizationId` (query param). If mismatch → `ORG_SCOPE_MISMATCH`.
4. Load `AuthMembership` for `(userId, organizationId)` with `status = active`. If not found → `MEMBERSHIP_MISSING`.
5. Load `AuthPolicy` for `(policyId, policyVersion)` from membership.
6. Project `granted_actions` from `policy.actions` — this is a projection/hint for UI only; server must recheck PBAC on each action.
7. Return workspace context. Do not return `policyId`, `policyVersion`, `tokenHash`, or internal policy conditions.

## Commands / Events

No audit event for read operations unless anomalous. PBAC allow/deny for sensitive workspace reads are logged by the PBAC guard.

## PBAC

- Requires valid session AND active membership.
- MFA check: if enrolled → must be verified.
- `granted_actions` is a projection — UI may use it to show/hide controls, but server enforces PBAC independently on every mutation.

## Test Cases

| ID | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| T01 | Valid session, active Manager membership | 200 with organization, user, role, granted_actions |
| T02 | MFA enrolled + not verified | 401 `MFA_REQUIRED` |
| T03 | Expired session | 401 `SESSION_INVALID` |
| T04 | org_scope_mismatch (session org ≠ query param org) | 403 `ORG_SCOPE_MISMATCH` |
| T05 | No membership in org | 403 `MEMBERSHIP_MISSING` |
| T06 | Response does not contain `policyId`, `policyVersion`, `tokenHash` | Safe projection verified |
| T07 | `granted_actions` matches `policy.actions` array | Projection matches DB |

## Definition of Done

- Workspace context returned for valid MFA-verified sessions with active membership.
- `MFA_REQUIRED` returned when MFA enrolled but not verified.
- Response does not leak policy internals or session token material.
- `granted_actions` is UI hint only — documented as non-authoritative.
