# PBAC Guard — NestJS Integration

## Outcome

Enforce Policy-Based Access Control on all protected endpoints via a reusable NestJS guard. Default deny: any missing attribute, missing policy, evaluator failure, or non-active membership results in 403. Never expose policy internals in error responses.

## Module Files

| File | Action | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/api/src/modules/auth-workspace/presentation/guards/pbac.guard.ts` | Create | NestJS `CanActivate` guard |
| `apps/api/src/modules/auth-workspace/presentation/decorators/require-action.decorator.ts` | Create | `@RequireAction('action:name')` endpoint decorator |
| `apps/api/src/modules/auth-workspace/presentation/decorators/require-session.decorator.ts` | Create | `@RequireSession()` endpoint decorator |
| `apps/api/src/modules/auth-workspace/application/services/auth-workspace/pbac-session.resolver.ts` | Create | Resolves `AuthSession` → `AuthMembership` → `AuthPolicy` context |
| `apps/api/src/modules/auth-workspace/auth-workspace.module.ts` | Modify | Register guard and decorators globally or per-module |

## Guard Behaviour

**Invocation:** `@UseGuards(PbacGuard)` + `@RequireAction('action:name')` on controller method.

**Evaluation steps (in order):**

1. Extract and validate session token (fingerprint + hash + expiry + `revokedAt = null`).
2. If MFA enrolled and `session.mfaVerifiedAt = null` → deny with `MFA_REQUIRED`.
3. Load `AuthMembership` for `(userId, session.organizationId, status = active)`. Missing → deny `MEMBERSHIP_MISSING`.
4. Load `AuthPolicy` for `(policyId, policyVersion)` from membership. Missing or version mismatch → deny `POLICY_NOT_FOUND`.
5. Check `policy.stateGate`. If `stateGate = membership_active` and membership not active → deny.
6. Evaluate `action ∈ policy.actions`. PBAC is an allowlist — only explicitly granted actions are allowed.
7. Evaluate subject attributes: `policy.subjectRole == membership.subjectAttributes.role`.
8. If all checks pass → allow. Log `AuthDecisionLog` with decision `allow`.
9. On any deny → log `AuthDecisionLog` with decision `deny` + reason code. Return 403 `PBAC_DENIED` (no policy internals in response).

**Default deny conditions:**
- Session invalid/expired/revoked
- MFA enrolled but unverified
- Membership not found or not active
- Policy not found
- Evaluator throws (treated as deny)
- `action` not in `policy.actions`
- Subject role mismatch

## Module Files (Infrastructure)

| File | Action | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/api/src/modules/auth-workspace/infrastructure/persistence/prisma-auth-workspace.repositories.ts` | Modify | Add session + membership + policy loaders used by guard |

## Prisma Models Used

| Model | Action | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `AuthSession` | Read | `tokenFingerprint`, `tokenHash`, `userId`, `organizationId`, `expiresAt`, `revokedAt`, `mfaVerifiedAt` |
| `AuthMembership` | Read | `userId`, `organizationId`, `status`, `subjectAttributes`, `policyId`, `policyVersion` |
| `AuthPolicy` | Read | `id`, `version`, `actions`, `subjectRole`, `stateGate` |
| `AuthDecisionLog` | Create | `decision`, `reasonCode`, `action`, `sessionId`, `userId`, `orgId`, `policyId`, `policyVersion` |

## Business Rules

1. Guard must be stateless — all context loaded per-request from DB (no in-memory policy cache without TTL).
2. Evaluator failure (DB error, exception) → deny. Never fallback to allow.
3. `policy.stateGate` values: `membership_active` → check membership status.
4. `granted_actions` from `GET /workspace` is a UI projection only. Guard always re-evaluates independently.
5. Policy internals (`policyId`, `policyVersion`, `actions` array) must not appear in 403 error responses.
6. `AuthDecisionLog` is written for every allow AND deny decision (for audit trail completeness).

## Commands / Events

| Name | Type | Safe payload |
|---|---|---|
| (No command — guard is infrastructure) | — | — |
| `event.pbac.decision` | `AuthDecisionLog` | `{ decision, reasonCode, action, sessionId, userId, orgId, policyId, policyVersion }` |

## PBAC

This file IS the PBAC implementation. No circular dependency.

## Test Cases

| ID | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| T01 | Valid session + active membership + action in policy | Pass (200 from endpoint) |
| T02 | Session expired | 403 `PBAC_DENIED` + deny logged |
| T03 | Session revoked | 403 `PBAC_DENIED` + deny logged |
| T04 | MFA enrolled + not verified | 403 `MFA_REQUIRED` + deny logged |
| T05 | No active membership | 403 `PBAC_DENIED` + deny logged |
| T06 | Policy not found | 403 `PBAC_DENIED` + deny logged |
| T07 | Action not in `policy.actions` | 403 `PBAC_DENIED` + deny logged |
| T08 | Subject role mismatch | 403 `PBAC_DENIED` + deny logged |
| T09 | Evaluator throws (DB error) | 403 `PBAC_DENIED` + deny logged |
| T10 | 403 response body has no policy internals | Response only has `error_code`, `correlation_id` |
| T11 | `AuthDecisionLog` written for allow | DB row with `decision = allow` |
| T12 | `AuthDecisionLog` written for deny | DB row with `decision = deny` + `reasonCode` |

## Definition of Done

- Default deny: any failure path returns 403, never 200.
- `@RequireAction` decorator sets required action; guard evaluates it against policy.
- `AuthDecisionLog` written for all allow and deny decisions.
- 403 response body never contains `policyId`, `policyVersion`, or `actions` array.
- Guard stateless per-request — loads fresh DB context each call.
