# Python Worker Platform Implementation Specification

## Status

AUTHORITATIVE BUILD DOCUMENT — A-to-Z RUNNABLE MVP

## Purpose

Define the common Python Worker Platform contract for all asynchronous domain workloads. This file owns platform-wide process, queue, configuration, observability, idempotency, persistence adapter, audit, and deployment rules.

Domain worker build details live in worker-specific implementation files:

- `docs/implementation/scanner-worker-implementation.md`
- `docs/implementation/legal-corpus-ingestion-implementation.md`
- `docs/implementation/chromadb-vectorless-legal-retriever-implementation.md`

This file is not the scanner runtime specification.

## Worker Modules

| Worker | Queue | Command | Primary Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scan Trigger Worker | `lcsp.scan-trigger-worker.v1` | `command.scan-trigger.resolve-context.v1` | trusted scan context or blocked trigger state |
| Scanner Worker | `lcsp.scan-worker.v1` | `command.scan.requested.v1` | `TechnicalEvidenceReport` |
| Technical Profile Worker | `lcsp.technical-profile-worker.v1` | `command.technical-profile.requested.v1` | `TechnicalProfile` |
| AI Usage Flow Worker | `lcsp.ai-usage-flow-worker.v1` | `command.ai-usage-flow.requested.v1` | `AIUsageFlow` |
| Reconciliation Worker | `lcsp.reconciliation-worker.v1` | `command.reconciliation.requested.v1` | `ReconciliationConflict` or `VerifiedProfile` |
| Legal Source Ingestion Worker | `lcsp.legal-source-ingest.v1` | `command.legal-source.ingest.requested.v1` | staged legal corpus artifacts |
| Legal Index Worker | `lcsp.legal-index-build.v1` | `command.legal-index-build.requested.v1` | ChromaDB vectorless legal index |
| Legal Matching Worker | `lcsp.legal-matching-worker.v1` | `command.legal-matching.requested.v1` | `LegalRuleMatch[]` |
| Classification Worker | `lcsp.classification-worker.v1` | `command.classification.requested.v1` | `RiskClassification` |
| Gap Analysis Worker | `lcsp.gap-analysis-worker.v1` | `command.gap-analysis.requested.v1` | `GapAnalysis` |
| Document Worker | `lcsp.document-worker.v1` | `command.document.requested.v1` | `GeneratedDocument` |
| Audit Export Worker | `lcsp.audit-export-worker.v1` | audit export command when activated | redacted audit export artifact |

Workers may be packaged as one monorepo package or independently deployable Python packages, but they must use the shared platform contracts above.

## Runtime Contract

Every worker process must:

1. Load validated configuration.
2. Validate PostgreSQL connectivity.
3. Validate RabbitMQ connectivity.
4. Validate required downstream service credentials for its own domain only.
5. Bind exactly its configured queue.
6. Consume one command schema family.
7. Acquire idempotent command lock before domain mutation.
8. Persist domain output before emitting downstream events.
9. Write `AuditEvent` for material state changes.
10. Write `OutboxEvent` in the same transaction as terminal state changes.
11. Stop accepting new work on shutdown and either complete or safely release in-flight work.

Workers do not publish RabbitMQ events directly inside domain transactions. An outbox publisher owns external publication.

## Shared Configuration

| Key | Secret | Applies To |
|---|---:|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | all workers |
| `RABBITMQ_URL` | Yes | all workers |
| `LCSP_ENV` | No | all workers |
| `LCSP_LOG_LEVEL` | No | all workers |
| `WORKER_NAME` | No | all workers |
| `WORKER_QUEUE` | No | all workers |
| `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` | No | all workers |
| `WORKER_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECONDS` | No | all workers |
| `WORKER_RETRY_PROFILE` | No | all workers |
| `LLM_PROVIDER_CONFIG_REF` | Yes | AIUsageFlow, Classification, Document |
| `CHROMADB_URL` | Yes | Legal Index, Legal Matching |
| `OBJECT_STORAGE_*` | Yes | Scanner, Legal Ingestion, Document, Audit Export |

Domain-specific configuration belongs in the domain implementation file.

## Idempotency and Retry

Every command handler must key idempotency by:

```text
command name
aggregate ID
command semantic version
input version/hash where applicable
```

Duplicate delivery must be a no-op or safe resume from persisted state. Retryable failures use bounded backoff and DLQ according to `docs/implementation/queue-implementation.md`. Domain guard failures persist blocked/failed state and are not retried blindly.

## Audit and Observability

Every worker writes redacted logs and audit records with:

- correlation ID;
- causation ID;
- command ID;
- aggregate reference;
- actor/service identity;
- worker name/version;
- policy ID/version when PBAC is evaluated;
- safe failure code and recovery hint when applicable.

Raw source, secrets, full prompts, provider tokens, and unredacted tool output must not appear in logs, queues, audit, or ordinary persistence.

## Acceptance

- Each listed active worker has a queue binding, command schema, idempotency behavior, terminal states, audit events, and outbox behavior.
- Scanner-specific runtime details are owned by `scanner-worker-implementation.md`, not this platform file.
- Legal retrieval-specific ChromaDB behavior is owned by `chromadb-vectorless-legal-retriever-implementation.md`.
- Duplicate command delivery does not duplicate domain artifacts.
- Terminal success emits exactly one downstream outbox event for that terminal transition.
- Terminal failure records safe failure reason, correlation ID, and recovery behavior.

## Non-Claims

- Not deployment authorization.
- Not a scanner behavior specification.
- Not implementation readiness certification.
