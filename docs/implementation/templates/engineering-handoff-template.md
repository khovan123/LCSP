# Engineering Handoff Template

## Purpose

Use this template for a wave, domain, or cross-task handoff packet. It gives implementation agents and reviewers the context needed to execute a group of tasks without loading the entire repository.

## Handoff Metadata

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Handoff ID | `HANDOFF-<wave-or-domain>-<slug>` |
| Status | `DRAFT` / `READY_FOR_PLANNING` / `READY_FOR_SPRINT` / `SUPERSEDED` |
| Wave / domain | |
| Primary owner | |
| Supporting owners | |
| Included tasks | |
| Source authority | Active docs only |

## Target Outcome

Describe what must be true when this handoff is complete.

## Authority Packet

| Area | Active source |
|---|---|
| Product | |
| Architecture / ADR | |
| Specs | |
| Implementation | |
| UX / stories | |
| Traceability | |

## Execution Order

```text
Task A
-> Task B
-> Task C
```

## Architecture Context

```mermaid

  A[Input] --> B[Owner Runtime]
  B --> C[Output Artifact]
```
