# Implementation Readiness Traceability Matrix

## Purpose

This matrix upgrades readiness traceability from FR-to-story coverage to certification-grade planning traceability:

```text
FR/NFR/UX/control -> story ID -> acceptance criterion ID -> test level -> owner -> evidence artifact
```

It is a planning/test-architecture artifact. It does not prove tests exist yet and does not authorize implementation by itself.

## Coverage Summary

| Priority | Total Criteria | Planning Trace Rows | Coverage % | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| P0 | 38 | 38 | 100% | Pass |
| P1 | 34 | 34 | 100% | Pass |
| P2 | 18 | 18 | 100% | Pass |
| P3 | 0 | 0 | 100% | Pass |
| **Total** | **90** | **90** | **100%** | **CONCERNS** |

Gate decision is `CONCERNS` because trace rows now exist, but executable test artifacts are not present in this readiness pass.

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps

No planning traceability gaps remain for active FR IDs.

### High Priority Gaps

Executable automated tests are not present in this planning artifact. Each row above identifies required test level and evidence artifact; implementation tasks must create or cite the concrete test files.

### Gate Decision

`CONCERNS`

Rationale: oracle confidence is high and planning trace rows are complete, but the current repository state does not yet provide executable automated evidence for every row.
