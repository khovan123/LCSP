# LCSP Multi-Agent System Architecture

## Status

AUTHORITATIVE MULTI-AGENT ARCHITECTURE

## Purpose

Define the agent/workflow roles in LCSP and the architectural guardrails for agentic processing. This document explains component responsibilities and routing principles. Implementation details live in `docs/implementation/`.

## Architectural Pattern

```text
State-machine-driven orchestration with bounded specialist workers.
```

LCSP does not use free-form autonomous handoffs for compliance-critical workflow. Each worker has a bounded responsibility and produces a typed output object or a blocked state.

## Worker Roles

| Worker / Agent | Responsibility | Must Not Do |
|---|---|---|
| Scanner Worker | Static repository analysis and TechnicalEvidenceReport creation. | Execute source, infer legal risk, send raw source to LLM. |
| Technical Profile Worker | Normalize scanner evidence into technical profile dimensions. | Invent business usage. |
| AIUsageFlow Worker | Produce evidence-backed business usage claims. | Classify legal risk or ignore uncertainty. |
| Reconciliation Worker | Detect conflicts and create VerifiedProfile only when clean/resolved. | Overwrite scanner evidence or let Developer unblock MVP alone. |
| Legal Matching Worker | Retrieve citation-backed legal rules. | Fabricate citations or use unpinned legal basis. |
| Classification Worker | Classify only from VerifiedProfile and citation-backed matches. | Classify before VerifiedProfile. |
| Gap Analysis Worker | Map classification to compliance gaps. | Generate final legal output. |
| Document Worker | Generate document artifacts under output guardrails. | Emit final legal conclusions without citation traceability. |

## Routing Principle

```text
Persisted object + event -> bounded worker -> persisted object + event/block.
```

Routing is deterministic and state-driven. LLM calls, when used, are tools behind guardrails and never own workflow state transitions.

## Human-In-The-Loop Rule

When WizardProfile, TechnicalProfile, or AIUsageFlow conflict, the workflow pauses and creates a Manager Conflict Resolution Task. Manager resolution is auditable and separate from scanner evidence.
