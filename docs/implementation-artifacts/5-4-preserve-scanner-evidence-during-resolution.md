# Story 5.4: Preserve Scanner Evidence During Resolution

Status: review

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

Preserve Scanner Evidence During Resolution

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** TechnicalEvidenceReport or TechnicalProfile is referenced by a conflict
   **When** Manager resolves the conflict
   **Then** LCSP stores resolution as a separate reconciliation decision
   **And** original scanner evidence, report hash, profile version, and finding refs remain immutable.

2. **Given** later scan rerun creates new evidence
   **When** reconciliation runs again
   **Then** LCSP creates a new reconciliation version or marks prior decisions for review as required
   **And** does not mutate historical resolutions.

3. **Given** audit or export views show reconciliation history
   **When** a user reviews the record
   **Then** LCSP displays evidence version, resolution version, actor, timestamp, and rationale trail.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Keep TechnicalEvidenceReport and TechnicalProfile immutable while storing reconciliation decisions separately. (AC: 1)
- [x] Carry evidence/report/profile version trail into reconciliation history and exports. (AC: 2)
- [x] Handle rerun-triggered new evidence by creating new reconciliation version or review-needed state. (AC: 3)

## Dev Notes

- Packet type: `planning-derived-developer-packet`
- Story key: `5-4-preserve-scanner-evidence-during-resolution`
- Official execution artifact: `docs/implementation-artifacts/5-4-preserve-scanner-evidence-during-resolution.md`
- Epic: `Epic 5 - Reconciliation and VerifiedProfile`
- Runtime ownership: `apps/api`, `lcsp-python-workers`, `packages/*`

### Current State and Scope Guardrails

- Epic 5 là gate quyết định facts nào được hợp thức hóa cho legal matching. Đây là nơi sai một lần sẽ làm classification dùng dữ liệu disputed.
- Story trong epic này phải giữ conflict detection, score explanation, Manager-only resolution và immutable history cùng lúc.
- VerifiedProfile là output duy nhất được phép đi tiếp sang legal matching; không có shortcut từ AIUsageFlow.

- Previous story context: `docs/developer/story-handbook/5-3-manager-conflict-resolution.md`
- Next story dependency seam: `docs/developer/story-handbook/5-5-create-verifiedprofile-after-gates-pass.md`
- Artifact chain for this epic: AIUsageFlow + WizardProfile + TechnicalProfile comparison -> conflict resolution -> VerifiedProfile.
- Workflow/state focus: AI_USAGE_FLOW_READY -> RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED / VERIFIED_PROFILE_READY / VERIFIED_PROFILE_APPROVED / VERIFIED_PROFILE_STALE.

### Story-Specific Implementation Tasks

- Keep TechnicalEvidenceReport and TechnicalProfile immutable while storing reconciliation decisions separately.
- Carry evidence/report/profile version trail into reconciliation history and exports.
- Handle rerun-triggered new evidence by creating new reconciliation version or review-needed state.

### Task to Acceptance Criteria Traceability

- `AC1`: Keep TechnicalEvidenceReport and TechnicalProfile immutable while storing reconciliation decisions separately.
- `AC2`: Carry evidence/report/profile version trail into reconciliation history and exports.
- `AC3`: Handle rerun-triggered new evidence by creating new reconciliation version or review-needed state.

### Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Story 5.3 resolution flow.
- Immutable evidence chain from Epic 3.

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No mutation of original evidence or profile hashes/refs.
- No historical resolution overwrite on rerun.
- No collapsed history view that hides version trail.

### Story-Specific Risks and Edge Cases

- Manager decision overwrites technical evidence.
- Rerun invalidates historical trail invisibly.
- Audit/export cannot show evidence-to-resolution lineage.

### Architecture Compliance

- Reconciliation logic thuộc Python Worker Platform, nhưng Manager resolution surfaces và approval endpoints vẫn cần PBAC/state enforcement ở API.
- Upstream artifacts `WizardProfile`, `TechnicalProfile`, `AIUsageFlow` là immutable inputs; worker chỉ tạo conflict/verified outputs mới.
- Manager-only actions phải được bảo vệ bằng PBAC subject/resource/action/context + version-safe checks.

### Functional and Domain Requirements

- Story này phải được triển khai đúng theo acceptance criteria của riêng nó; không kéo behavior của story sau vào cùng slice nếu không có seam thật sự cần thiết.
- Domain chain liên quan của Epic 5: AIUsageFlow + WizardProfile + TechnicalProfile comparison -> conflict resolution -> VerifiedProfile.
- Khi story chạm workflow gate, blocked/degraded path là một phần của yêu cầu chứ không phải edge-case tuỳ chọn.


### Data and Persistence Requirements

- Các story Epic 5 thường chạm `ConflictCandidate`, `ConflictResolution`, `VerifiedProfile`, profile versions, approval records và audit events.
- Conflict score/rationale phải trace được về evidence refs và source profile versions để reviewer/Manager hiểu vì sao bị block.
- Scanner evidence, TechnicalProfile và AIUsageFlow refs phải được preserve nguyên vẹn trong output chain.

### State and Audit Requirements

- Unresolved material conflict phải giữ state `RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED` và block classification.
- Manager resolution, VerifiedProfile creation, approval và stale transitions đều phải audit với version/correlation metadata.
- Upstream rerun phải có thể supersede VerifiedProfile cũ mà không mutate lịch sử.

### File Structure Notes

- `lcsp-python-workers` cho reconciliation worker, score calculation, VerifiedProfile generation.
- `apps/api` cho Manager resolution/approval command surface và status projection.
- `packages/*` cho conflict schema, score explanation contract, verified profile DTOs.

### Implementation Guidance for the Dev Agent

- Không để Developer finalize conflict resolution hoặc approval paths vốn Manager-scoped.
- Giải thích conflict score phải bám evidence-basis thật; không trả opaque score mà không có rationale.
- Nếu input version stale, reject rõ ràng và buộc refresh thay vì silently accept resolution.

### Testing Requirements

- Worker tests cho conflict detection/materiality threshold/VerifiedProfile gates.
- API tests cho Manager-only resolution/approval and stale-submission rejection.
- Immutable history, superseded version và audit trace assertions.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

GPT-5 Codex

### Debug Log References

- Batch `bmad-create-story` run on 2026-07-02T22:01:26+07:00.
- Source packet: `docs/developer/story-handbook/5-4-preserve-scanner-evidence-during-resolution.md`.
- Canonical title/source alignment: `docs/planning-artifacts/epics.md`.

### Completion Notes List

- Added a versioned `ReconciliationDecision` persistence record so Manager resolution is stored separately from immutable scanner evidence and profile rows.
- Resolve-conflict now snapshots conflict evidence refs, TechnicalEvidenceReport hash/version, TechnicalProfile version, actor, timestamp, rationale, and original status before updating the current conflict projection.
- Reconciliation context and internal verified-profile context now expose resolution history and evidence/profile version trail for audit/export and worker consumption.
- Verified profile worker summaries carry resolution/evidence version metadata while continuing to omit Manager private resolution notes.
- Validation passed: API focused reconciliation Jest specs, verified-profile worker pytest suite, and `@lcsp/api` build.
- E2E validation was attempted but blocked by unavailable local Docker daemon for Testcontainers.
- Repository-wide `pnpm run check:contracts` still reports pre-existing contract-literal violations outside this story slice.
