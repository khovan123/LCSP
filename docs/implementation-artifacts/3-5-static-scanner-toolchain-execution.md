# Story 3.5: Static Scanner Toolchain Execution

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

Static Scanner Toolchain Execution

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** a RepositoryScanJob is locked in a restricted workspace
   **When** scanner execution starts
   **Then** LCSP runs approved bounded static analysis tools including Syft, Knip, deptry, Python `ast`/`libcst`, `ts-morph`, tree-sitter/custom parser, and Semgrep as applicable by repository language profile
   **And** records tool versions, config hash, ruleset hash, start/end time, language profile, and coverage limitations.

2. **Given** a repository language profile does not support a tool
   **When** the scanner builds the execution plan
   **Then** LCSP skips the unsupported tool with an explicit coverage limitation
   **And** does not treat the skip as successful evidence for that capability.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Build language-profile-aware execution plan for approved static tools. (AC: 1)
- [ ] Record tool versions, config hash, ruleset hash and coverage limitations per run. (AC: 2)
- [ ] Skip unsupported tools explicitly instead of treating absence as success. (AC: 2)

## Dev Notes

- Packet type: `planning-derived-developer-packet`
- Story key: `3-5-static-scanner-toolchain-execution`
- Official execution artifact: `docs/implementation-artifacts/3-5-static-scanner-toolchain-execution.md`
- Epic: `Epic 3 - Trusted Repository Evidence and TechnicalProfile`
- Runtime ownership: `apps/api`, `lcsp-python-workers`, `packages/*`

### Current State and Scope Guardrails

- Epic 3 là bridge từ assessment sang trusted technical evidence. Đây là boundary dễ phá privacy nhất nếu implementation lỏng tay.
- Story trong epic này phải giữ scanner là static-analysis only và không được kéo scan execution vào web request lifecycle.
- Handoff chính của epic là `RepositorySnapshot`, `TechnicalEvidenceReport`, rồi `TechnicalProfile`; ba artifact này phải giữ boundary rõ.

- Previous story context: `docs/developer/story-handbook/3-4-static-scanner-workspace-and-sandbox.md`
- Next story dependency seam: `docs/developer/story-handbook/3-6-scan-failure-severity-and-evidence-acceptance-policy.md`
- Artifact chain for this epic: repository connection -> commit-pinned snapshot -> trusted scan trigger -> scanner execution -> TechnicalEvidenceReport -> TechnicalProfile.
- Workflow/state focus: repository/snapshot/scan/evidence/profile states from REPOSITORY_CONNECTED to TECHNICAL_PROFILE_READY.

### Story-Specific Implementation Tasks

- Build language-profile-aware execution plan for approved static tools.
- Record tool versions, config hash, ruleset hash and coverage limitations per run.
- Skip unsupported tools explicitly instead of treating absence as success.

### Task to Acceptance Criteria Traceability

- `AC1`: Build language-profile-aware execution plan for approved static tools.
- `AC2`: Record tool versions, config hash, ruleset hash and coverage limitations per run.
- `AC2`: Skip unsupported tools explicitly instead of treating absence as success.

### Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Story 3.4 restricted workspace.
- Pinned toolchain and language-profile metadata.

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No unapproved tools or dynamic installs.
- No semantic conclusion from skipped tool.
- No long-running unbounded analysis outside resource policy.

### Story-Specific Risks and Edge Cases

- Unsupported tool treated as positive evidence.
- Tool provenance not captured for downstream trust.
- Execution plan exceeds bounded resource policy.

### Architecture Compliance

- NestJS API chỉ tạo trusted trigger, persist status và enqueue command qua outbox; Python Worker Platform sở hữu scan/tool execution và downstream profile work.
- Scanner worker phải dùng restricted workspace, pinned tools, bounded resources và cleanup verification trước completed event.
- TechnicalProfile là artifact kỹ thuật bất biến; không được dùng như AIUsageFlow, VerifiedProfile hay compliance status.

### Functional and Domain Requirements

- Story này phải được triển khai đúng theo acceptance criteria của riêng nó; không kéo behavior của story sau vào cùng slice nếu không có seam thật sự cần thiết.
- Domain chain liên quan của Epic 3: repository connection -> commit-pinned snapshot -> trusted scan trigger -> scanner execution -> TechnicalEvidenceReport -> TechnicalProfile.
- Khi story chạm workflow gate, blocked/degraded path là một phần của yêu cầu chứ không phải edge-case tuỳ chọn.


### Data and Persistence Requirements

- Các story Epic 3 thường chạm `RepositoryConnection`, `RepositorySnapshot`, `ScanJob`, `TechnicalEvidenceReport`, `TechnicalProfile`, outbox event và audit metadata.
- Raw source không được thành persistent store thông thường; snapshot/workspace là ephemeral hoặc tightly-controlled artifact boundary.
- Tool provenance, config/ruleset hash, severity policy và evidence refs là dữ liệu bắt buộc cho downstream trust.

### State and Audit Requirements

- State authority trọng tâm gồm `REPOSITORY_CONNECTED`, `TRUSTED_SCAN_TRIGGERED`, `SNAPSHOT_CREATED`, `SCAN_REQUESTED`, `SCAN_RUNNING`, `SCAN_COMPLETED`, `TECHNICAL_EVIDENCE_READY`, `TECHNICAL_PROFILE_READY`.
- Cleanup/privacy/provenance failure phải block chain và không cho TechnicalProfile downstream.
- Rerun phải tạo immutable chain mới thay vì mutate scan/evidence/profile lịch sử.

### File Structure Notes

- `apps/api` cho repository selection, scan request/status API và outbox command creation.
- `lcsp-python-workers` cho queue consumer, scanner runtime, evidence gates, TechnicalProfile worker.
- `packages/*` cho command/event schemas, status projection contracts, evidence/profile DTOs.

### Implementation Guidance for the Dev Agent

- Không reintroduce manual upload path hoặc Local/CI report upload; trusted scan là golden path duy nhất.
- Command/event naming, idempotency key và retry/DLQ behavior phải bám authority docs thay vì tự phát minh.
- Khi evidence chưa đủ hoặc provenance/privacy fail, hãy block/degrade rõ ràng thay vì overclaim “scan completed”.

### Testing Requirements

- API/worker contract tests cho trusted trigger, outbox enqueue và status projection.
- Scanner sandbox/cleanup security tests, provenance/severity policy assertions.
- TechnicalEvidenceReport gate coverage và immutable TechnicalProfile versioning tests.
