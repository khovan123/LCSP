# LCSP-333 managed sandbox release gate

LCSP-333 release readiness is blocked until a managed-sandbox proof artifact is
validated. Unit tests, mocked sandbox declarations, GitHub CI alone, or code
review PASS are not sufficient proof.

## Commands

Validate a real managed-sandbox proof:

```bash
pnpm run check:managed-sandbox-release-gate -- \
  --proof artifacts/lcsp333-managed-sandbox-proof.json \
  --out artifacts/lcsp333-managed-sandbox-gate-result.json
```

Validate the gate implementation itself:

```bash
pnpm run test:managed-sandbox-release-gate
```

For pull requests that touch the release-gate surface, CI also requires the
`Managed sandbox proof` job. It runs on a self-hosted runner carrying
the `lcsp-managed-sandbox` label. That runner must provide the
`lcsp-managed-sandbox-proof` executable. The executable is the production
proof producer: it must start the canonical PR-triggered review run, exercise
Scanner → PGE → Interview or governed no-interview → EngineeringRule → Planner
→ Investigator, observe durable runtime/Web evidence and restart
reconciliation, re-check GitHub CI/mergeability and the final PR head, sanitize
the evidence, and write `LCSP333_MANAGED_SANDBOX_PROOF_V1` to the requested
`--out` path. Missing runner capacity, a missing producer executable, or a
missing/invalid proof fails the required job; fixture proof is not accepted by
this CI path.

The privileged producer job is restricted to same-repository pull-request
branches. Fork pull requests never execute on the self-hosted managed-sandbox
runner. The always-created Managed sandbox readiness gate runs only on
GitHub-hosted isolated compute, so NOT_APPLICABLE and fork decisions never
depend on or execute commands on the privileged runner. A fork or unavailable
sandbox fails closed unless a separately governed trusted workflow/service
supplies an approved exemption outcome without executing fork-controlled
workflow code on the managed-sandbox host. The privileged job does not check out PR code, install PR
dependencies, or execute repository lifecycle scripts on the host. It invokes
only host-managed producer and verifier binaries with immutable PR/base/head
identifiers and writes into a fresh runner-temporary proof directory.

The host-managed verifier is the authoritative proof-validation boundary. It
validates schema, exact-head identity, lifecycle/correlation, CI/mergeability,
and privacy before any proof is uploaded to GitHub. Only a proof that passes
this trusted pre-upload verification may be persisted as an Actions artifact.
The trusted gate result must record the verifier version or hash for
auditability.

The branch-protection authority is deliberately separate from this
PR-controlled workflow. The live develop ruleset requires the status context
Managed sandbox readiness gate, but no job in this pull-request workflow emits
that context. The job here is named Managed sandbox readiness diagnostic and is
non-authoritative. The required context must be published for the exact head by
a trusted GitHub App/external governance service or a workflow definition
resolved exclusively from a protected base ref. That trusted control plane must
validate the host-managed proof or governed exemption before publishing
success. A candidate PR therefore cannot preserve the required context name and
turn its implementation into an unconditional success.

The PR-owned diagnostic treats a pull request outside the release_gate path
surface as NOT_APPLICABLE and succeeds on GitHub-hosted compute without starting
a managed sandbox, but that diagnostic cannot satisfy branch protection. For an
applicable same-repository pull request, it consumes only the gate result emitted
by the same-repository trusted producer/verifier. The pull-request workflow does
not mint exemptions or publish the authoritative required context.

The trusted control plane publishes Managed sandbox readiness gate only after
binding its decision to the exact repository, PR, base SHA and head SHA. It may
publish NOT_APPLICABLE according to protected policy, accept a verified
managed-sandbox result, or accept a separately governed exemption. Exemptions
must originate outside candidate-PR control and fail closed when expired,
mismatched, replayed or unapproved. Fork-controlled workflow commands must never
execute on the managed-sandbox host.

If the managed sandbox is unavailable, release governance may provide a
time-boxed exemption artifact:

```bash
pnpm run check:managed-sandbox-release-gate -- \
  --exemption artifacts/lcsp333-non-sandbox-exemption.json \
  --out artifacts/lcsp333-managed-sandbox-gate-result.json
```

An exemption is not a READY verdict. It records why the sandbox proof was not
available and must be accepted separately by release governance.

## Required proof artifact

The proof JSON must use schema version
`LCSP333_MANAGED_SANDBOX_PROOF_V1` and prove one correlated production-equivalent
execution:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "LCSP333_MANAGED_SANDBOX_PROOF_V1",
  "run": {
    "prNumber": 338,
    "runId": "review-run-338-1",
    "generation": 1,
    "baseSha": "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb",
    "headSha": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
    "triggerType": "webhook:synchronize",
    "triggerId": "delivery-338",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "terminalVerdict": "READY"
  }
}
```

The full artifact must also include:

- exact-head evidence: pinned PR head, sandbox checkout SHA, and final head
  re-check;
- one authoritative canonical run for the current PR/head/generation whose
  lifecycle state matches run.status; the run must be terminal, and READY/PASS
  is valid only with run.status=COMPLETED;
- restart reconciliation proving stale/orphaned runs were superseded, cancelled
  or failed with a reason;
- managed sandbox host kind, sanitized log refs and artifact refs;
- exact-head CI check-run IDs, pending checks and GitHub mergeability state;
- completed pipeline stages from PR trigger through terminal verdict, including
  Scanner, PGE, Interview/no-interview branch, EngineeringRule selection and
  evaluation, Planner, Investigator, runtime persistence and Web/SSE
  observability;
- correlation IDs for PR/run/head/assessment/scanner/PGE/runtime/agent/rule/tool
  and check runs;
- persisted UI-visible runtime event classes required to reconstruct the Web
  timeline after reconnect/restart;
- regression evidence for PR #335 duplicate-run cleanup, PR #338 green
  exact-head readiness, PR #336 code-PASS-but-CI-pending non-readiness, and
  selected-run cancellation isolation.

## Privacy invariants

The proof and linked logs/artifacts must already be sanitized before validation.
The validator rejects secret-like values and raw fields named like system
prompts, developer prompts, hidden reasoning, private context, unrestricted
source, credentials, API keys, passwords or access tokens unless they are
explicitly redacted.

Never include:

- credentials, token-bearing URLs or secret environment values;
- raw system/developer prompts;
- hidden chain-of-thought or hidden model reasoning;
- unrestricted customer/private context;
- unrestricted repository source.
