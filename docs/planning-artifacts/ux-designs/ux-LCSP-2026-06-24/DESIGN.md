# LCSP Design Spine

## Rebase Status

This design spine is rebased against the Phase 5.2L active authority set. It is the active UX visual-design draft for canonical UX review and epic/story generation.

Historical UX material under `docs/archive/` is excluded from active UX authority. Any archived references to structured attestation forms, manual technical evidence JSON upload, Local/CI scanner report upload as an MVP evidence path, RBAC authority, or pgvector/embedding-first legal retrieval are superseded.

## Brand & Style

LCSP reads as a compliance workbench: quiet, explicit, and evidence-first. The interface should help a Manager understand what is known, what is missing, what is blocked, and what can be done next without implying legal certification or unsupported certainty.

The visual language is operational rather than promotional. Dense information is acceptable when it is structured, grouped, and scannable. Avoid marketing hero layouts, decorative illustrations, large emotional gradients, or chatbot-style surfaces that imply informal legal advice.

## Implementation Stack (Hard Constraint)

The frontend implementation stack for `apps/web` is decided and non-negotiable:

- **Tailwind CSS v4.3** utility classes for all styling — confirmed in `apps/web/package.json` (`tailwindcss: ^4.3.2`).
- **shadcn/ui on Base UI primitives** (`@base-ui/react`, `shadcn` CLI) for interactive components — confirmed in `apps/web/package.json` and `apps/web/components.json`. Primitives live under `apps/web/src/components/ui`.
- **Atomic Design** for reusable, domain-neutral composition — `apps/web/src/components/{atoms,molecules,organisms}`. Feature-specific composition lives under `apps/web/src/features/<feature>/components/{molecules,organisms}`, not in the shared atomic tree.

**Forbidden:** plain `.css` files, CSS Modules (`*.module.css`), CSS-in-JS, inline `style=` for anything expressible as a Tailwind utility, and hand-authored classes outside `globals.css`'s `@theme` token layer. The only sanctioned non-Tailwind CSS file is `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`, and only for `@theme`/token declarations (see Token Binding under Auth Surface below) — never for component-level rules.

**Known violation (found 2026-07-11):** `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` still imports `apps/web/src/app/page.module.css` — the untouched `create-next-app` scaffold, never migrated. It also hardcodes English copy ("LCSP Web App", "Scaffolded with create-next-app...") outside `@lcsp/i18n`. Needs a cleanup pass before this route is treated as the real landing/root page.

## Colors

- **Primary blue (`{colors.primary}`)** is used for primary commands, selected navigation, and active step emphasis. It signals official product action, not legal approval.
- **Neutral surfaces (`{colors.background}`, `{colors.surface}`, `{colors.surface-muted}`)** carry most of the UI. Evidence and audit content should remain readable in long sessions.
- **Warning amber (`{colors.warning}` / `{colors.surface-warning}`)** marks blocked, degraded, insufficient, or needs-review states. It must not be used as decoration.
- **Success green (`{colors.success}` / `{colors.surface-success}`)** marks completed gates or generated artifacts only after prerequisites pass.
- **Danger red (`{colors.danger}` / `{colors.surface-danger}`)** is reserved for destructive actions, denied access, failed security/privacy checks, and report-blocking guardrail violations.
- **Info blue (`{colors.info}`)** marks informational provenance, corpus version, and audit references.

## Typography

Use a system sans-serif stack. LCSP is a repeated-use operational tool; typography should prioritize legibility, stable table layout, and clear hierarchy over expressive brand moments.

Reserve `{typography.display}` for workspace-level page titles. Wizard panels, evidence cards, conflict tasks, and document states use `{typography.headline}` or smaller. Dense metadata, evidence refs, legal chunk IDs, corpus versions, and audit IDs use `{typography.caption}` with sufficient contrast.

## Layout & Spacing

Primary layout is responsive web with a persistent desktop sidebar, a top workspace bar, and a constrained main content region. Mobile and tablet layouts collapse navigation into a sheet and stack panels in workflow order.

Use the spacing scale consistently: `16px` for ordinary panel spacing, `24px` for section gaps, and `32px` for major workflow separation. Fixed-format elements such as step indicators, status rows, citation chips, and action bars must keep stable dimensions so text/status updates do not shift the layout.

## Elevation & Depth

Use borders and tonal surfaces before shadows. Cards represent actual grouped work objects: assessment, wizard section, evidence report, conflict, legal match, gap item, document artifact. Do not use cards as decorative page sections or nest cards inside cards.

Dialogs and sheets may use modest elevation to establish modality. Long-running status, audit, and legal citation surfaces should remain flat and inspectable.

## Shapes

Use tight radii: `{rounded.sm}` for chips and small controls, `{rounded.md}` for buttons and inputs, `{rounded.lg}` for work-object cards and dialogs. Avoid pill-shaped buttons except for short status badges where the shape improves scanning.

## Components

- **Primary button** — `{components.primary-button}`. One primary command per surface or modal footer.
- **Evidence card** — `{components.evidence-card}`. Shows source, state, confidence, limitations, and next action. Must not hide limitations behind hover-only UI.
- **Blocked banner** — `{components.blocked-banner}`. Contains reason, affected stage, next action, and audit/reference ID when available.
- **Citation chip** — `{components.citation-chip}`. Shows legal document/article/clause/point. Opens citation detail with corpus version, effective date, context role, and provenance.
- **Stepper** — horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile. Must distinguish completed, current, blocked, deferred, and not-yet-eligible states.
- **Status badge** — short state labels only: `Ready`, `Blocked`, `Needs review`, `Generated`, `Readiness only`.
- **Data table** — used for audit events, evidence findings, legal references, and generated documents. Must support filtering, wrapping, and redacted metadata display.

## Auth Surface (Sign-In, MFA Verify, Accept Invitation)

Unauthenticated and pre-workspace screens (sign-in, MFA challenge, developer invitation acceptance) are single-column, centered operational forms — not marketing entry points. They must not use a decorative hero/brand panel, gradient shapes, or bespoke color tokens outside this spine.

- **Layout** — one `{components.form-card}` centered in the viewport, max-width ~28rem, on `{colors.background}`. No split-screen hero panel.
- **Branding** — a small static wordmark/logo lockup only (`{typography.caption}`-scale, top-left or centered above the form). No full-bleed decorative panel, gradient, or animated entrance.
- **Color** — use `{colors.primary}` for the submit action and `{colors.surface}` for the card only. Do not introduce new brand-only tokens (e.g. a separate "brand-surface"/"brand-accent" family) — extend this spine's token table first if a new need is identified.
- **Copy** — eyebrow/heading/subtext are allowed but stay short and operational ("Sign in to LCSP"), not promotional taglines.
- **Errors** — use `{components.blocked-banner}` styling (inline, not a full-page takeover) for invalid credentials, lockout, MFA failure, and revoked-invitation states.

### Token Binding

Placeholder tokens in this spine (`{colors.primary}`, `{colors.surface}`, etc.) resolve to the shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS variable set already wired in `apps/web/src/app/globals.css` — the frontend UI system is confirmed (see resolved Open Question 1 in `EXPERIENCE.md`). New pages must reuse those existing CSS variables; do not declare new token families in `globals.css` without adding them to this spine first.

## Do's and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Show evidence, provenance, limitations, and next action together | Show a risk level before gates pass |
| Use warning color for blocked/degraded state | Use warning color as visual emphasis |
| Make citations inspectable by document/article/clause/point | Show vague legal source labels |
| Keep legal and audit metadata readable | Hide critical provenance in tooltips only |
| Use restrained operational density | Build a marketing-style landing page as the first screen |
| Label readiness-only output clearly | Make readiness look like final classification |
| Use one centered form card for sign-in/MFA/invite screens | Build a split-screen hero panel with decorative gradients for auth screens |
