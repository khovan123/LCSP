# LCSP Story-Task Breakdown

Regenerated backlog model for the next Jira project.

## Operating Model

- `Epic` = business module.
- `Story` = acceptance and traceability anchor linked to an implementation artifact.
- `Task` = smallest shippable feature slice under one story, assigned directly to a dev owner.
- `Sub-task` = removed from this operating model.

## Practical Jira Rule

- Import `Epic` first, then `Story`, then `Task`.
- Fill `Epic Link` in story/task CSV after Jira returns new epic issue keys.
- Use `Task` as the only dev-assigned implementation item.
- Keep `Story` open until all mapped `Task` items are done and acceptance passes.
- Do not create `Sub-task` items in the new project.
