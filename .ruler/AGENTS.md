## Contract value-set typing

- Do not define TypeScript enums for app/domain value sets. Use `as const` objects and derive types from them.
- Do not define direct string literal unions such as `type Status = "A" | "B"`. Define a constant source first, then derive the type:

  ```ts
  export const EVIDENCE_SEVERITIES = {
    low: "LOW",
    medium: "MEDIUM",
    high: "HIGH",
  } as const;

  export type EvidenceSeverity =
    (typeof EVIDENCE_SEVERITIES)[keyof typeof EVIDENCE_SEVERITIES];
  ```

- Apply the same rule to discriminators such as `kind`, `type`, `status`, `reason`, `requiredAction`, and UI state strings. Local UI-only states may keep local constants, but domain/API values must live in `packages/contracts`.
- Canonical domain/API values must use one format: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. Do not introduce mixed styles such as `pending`, `pending_approval`, `FinalReport`, or `accessRevoked` for contract values.
- Hardcoded error codes, status values, workflow values, PBAC actions, scan statuses, evidence severities, document types, lifecycle statuses, audit/resource/reason/aggregate values, and wizard/assessment statuses must be imported from `packages/contracts`; do not repeat raw strings in `apps/web` or `apps/api`.
- `apps/api` may translate between Prisma enums and contract constants only at explicit persistence boundaries. Do not leak Prisma enum values into controllers, BFF responses, or shared contracts.
- For bounded database value sets in `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`, use Prisma enums instead of plain `String` fields when the set is closed. The enum members themselves must also be `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`; do not rely on lower/mixed-case Prisma members plus `@map(...)` to simulate the canonical value set.
- Tests must assert the value set of the layer they exercise: contract/API tests use shared contract constants, and Prisma persistence tests use Prisma enums or shared mapper helpers for that boundary.
- Before finishing a TS change, search changed code for direct literal unions and enums:
  `rg 'type [A-Za-z0-9_]+\\s*=\\s*"[^"]+"\\s*\\||^\\s*\\|\\s*"[^"]+"|\\benum\\b'`.

## API result contract

- Backend JSON controllers must return one envelope contract for success and failure:
  - success: `{ ok: true, data }`
  - failure: `{ ok: false, problem: { type, status, code, titleKey, detailKey, requiredAction, correlationId, meta } }`
- The HTTP status code must match `problem.status` in the failure body. If status metadata is emitted elsewhere, it must match the same value. Add or update tests when touching problem factories, filters, or interceptors.
- Use the backend problem factory/global exception filter for failures instead of ad hoc response shapes. Do not introduce legacy shapes such as `{ error_code }`, `{ code }`, or custom per-controller error bodies.
- Success responses for JSON controllers must also use the shared envelope directly from backend helpers/interceptors; do not return bare DTOs from some controllers and wrapped DTOs from others.
- Do not apply a global success wrapper to stream/download endpoints unless the endpoint is explicitly JSON-only.

## Web BFF and API client layer

- Keep Next route handlers as BFF/proxy code. They should use shared server helpers for upstream calls, bearer/session handling, query param normalization, result JSON, and payload validation. Do not repeat `fetch(apiBaseUrl...)`, `response.json()`, credential/session cookie guards, or pagination parsing in every route.
- When a web business rule depends on server-side routing behavior such as auth gates, tenant/workspace entry, redirects before render, locale routing, or route-level access control, prefer a Next server-side route proxy (`apps/web/src/proxy.ts` with `export function proxy`) over client-side redirects or component-level guards. Do not add the deprecated `middleware.ts` convention for Next 16+; use Proxy naming, matcher coverage, and focused tests for the protected route set. Proxy is an early routing guard only; backend API/PBAC enforcement remains the source of truth.
- `LCSP_API_BASE_URL` must be read in one shared upstream helper, not repeatedly inside `apps/web/src/app/api` or client modules.
- Shared upstream server logic belongs under `apps/web/src/lib/server` such as `upstream-request.ts`; do not keep Next BFF proxy code in `apps/web/src/lib/api`.
- Shared session/cookie guards, repeated query param normalization, and repeated success/problem forwarding must be centralized in helpers instead of copied across route handlers.
- Client-side API calls must go through the shared `apiRequest` helper so envelope parsing and credential behavior are centralized.
- TanStack Query belongs in `*-queries.ts` hooks. Query hooks orchestrate caching/retries only; envelope parsing stays in `apiRequest`, and domain mapping from `problem.code` to page outcomes stays in domain client modules, using shared outcome constants instead of raw `kind` strings.
- Avoid keeping old `*-client.ts` modules as thin wrappers with duplicated fetch logic. If a domain module remains, it should exist for domain outcome mapping, not to re-implement request plumbing already handled by shared helpers.
- Keep server-only proxy helpers under `apps/web/src/lib/server`, not under `apps/web/src/lib/api`.

## Mock data placement

- All mock payload data must live under `apps/web/src/public/assets/mocks`.
- Type definitions, fixture readers, cookie constants, and mock-mode helpers may live under server/helper folders, but they must not embed mock payload objects that should be JSON assets.
- Do not add mock JSON, fixture payloads, or seed-like web data outside `apps/web/src/public/assets/mocks`.

## Frontend form architecture

- In `apps/web`, non-trivial forms must use `react-hook-form` for form state and `zod` for validation. Do not introduce new manual form state stacks built from scattered `useState`, bespoke field error maps, and per-field submit plumbing when a form abstraction is appropriate.
- Feature form schemas must live in sibling `schemas/` files, with exported inferred types reused by containers and field components. Do not inline large `zod` schemas inside page or organism components.
- Prefer `FormProvider`, `useFormContext`, and `Controller` in reusable field molecules/organisms so parent containers do not have to thread `value`, `error`, and mutation callbacks through every field.
- Keep orchestration concerns such as autosave, step transitions, submit side effects, and API outcomes in the feature form container; keep field rendering and field binding in atomic components.

## Debugging and bug-fixing protocol

When debugging, fixing a bug, or tracing an error, the response **must** include two clearly labelled sections before or alongside any code change:

1. **Root cause** – Explain _why_ the bug occurred: the exact code path, incorrect assumption, race condition, stale closure, wrong contract shape, etc. Be specific enough that a reader who was not involved can understand the failure without running the code.
2. **Fix** – Explain _how_ the fix works: what changed, why it resolves the root cause, and any trade-offs or follow-up risks.

Do not skip either section even for seemingly trivial fixes. If both sections can be stated in one sentence each, that is acceptable, but they must appear.
