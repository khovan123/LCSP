## Tailwind CSS v4.3 utility policy

- Before adding or editing a Tailwind class, prefer the canonical Tailwind v4.3 utility over an arbitrary value whenever both produce the same CSS.
- Do not write `min-h-[100dvh]`, `min-h-[18rem]`, `rounded-[2px]`, or equivalent arbitrary forms when `min-h-dvh`, `min-h-72`, and `rounded-sm` exist.
- Use an arbitrary value only when there is no semantically equivalent built-in utility (for example, `clamp()`, `min()`, a `ch` measure, or an approved design token not represented in Tailwind's scale).
- During frontend review, search changed TSX/JSX for `-[` utilities and replace every built-in-equivalent occurrence before declaring the task complete.

## Frontend Atomic Design boundaries

- Keep shadcn primitives in `apps/web/src/components/ui`. Keep reusable Atomic Design components in `apps/web/src/components/{atoms,molecules,organisms}`; they must remain domain-neutral and reusable across features.
- Keep feature-specific composition in `apps/web/src/features/<feature>/components/{molecules,organisms}`. Do not place feature components directly under `features/<feature>/molecules` or `features/<feature>/organisms`.
- Put schemas, types, and static configuration in sibling `schemas/`, `types/`, and `config/` directories, never inline in a component.
- All customer-facing copy, including labels, helper text, validation messages, alerts, metadata, and accessible labels, must be represented by keys and resolved from `@lcsp/i18n`; never hardcode display strings in `apps/web`.

## Frontend form architecture

- In `apps/web`, non-trivial forms must use `react-hook-form` for form state and `zod` for validation. Do not build new forms around ad hoc `useState` field state plus manual error maps when the UI is a real form.
- Form schemas must live in feature-local sibling `schemas/` files; do not inline `z.object(...)` definitions inside page or component files.
- Reusable field molecules and organisms should bind through `react-hook-form` context (`FormProvider`, `useFormContext`, `Controller`) instead of receiving parallel `value`/`error`/`setError` plumbing from every parent.
- Keep draft-saving, submit orchestration, and step navigation in the form container, but keep field rendering and field-level wiring in atomic components.

## Contract value-set typing

- Do not define TypeScript enums for app/domain value sets. Use `as const` objects and derive types from them.
- Do not define direct string literal unions such as `type Status = "A" | "B"`. Define a constant source first, then derive the type:
  ```ts
  export const EVIDENCE_SEVERITIES = {
    low: "LOW",
    medium: "MEDIUM",
    high: "HIGH",
  } as const;

  export type EvidenceSeverity =
    (typeof EVIDENCE_SEVERITIES)[keyof typeof EVIDENCE_SEVERITIES];
  ```
- Apply the same rule to discriminators such as `kind`, `type`, `status`, `reason`, `requiredAction`, and UI state strings. Local UI-only states may keep local constants, but domain/API values must live in `packages/contracts`.
- Canonical domain/API values must use one format: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. Do not introduce mixed styles such as `pending`, `pending_approval`, `FinalReport`, or `accessRevoked` for contract values.
- Hardcoded error codes, status values, workflow values, PBAC actions, scan statuses, evidence severities, document types, lifecycle statuses, audit/resource/reason/aggregate values, and wizard/assessment statuses must be imported from `packages/contracts`; do not repeat raw strings in `apps/web` or `apps/api`.
- `apps/api` may translate between Prisma enums and contract constants only at explicit persistence boundaries. Do not leak Prisma enum values into controllers, BFF responses, or shared contracts.
- For bounded database value sets in `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`, use Prisma enums instead of plain `String` fields when the set is closed. The enum members themselves must also be `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`; do not rely on lower/mixed-case Prisma members plus `@map(...)` to simulate the canonical value set.
- Tests must assert the value set of the layer they exercise: contract/API tests use shared contract constants, and Prisma persistence tests use Prisma enums or shared mapper helpers for that boundary.
- Before finishing a TS change, search changed code for direct literal unions and enums:
  `rg 'type [A-Za-z0-9_]+\\s*=\\s*"[^"]+"\\s*\\||^\\s*\\|\\s*"[^"]+"|\\benum\\b'`.

## API result contract

- Backend JSON controllers must return one envelope contract for success and failure:
  - success: `{ ok: true, data }`
  - failure: `{ ok: false, problem: { type, status, code, titleKey, detailKey, requiredAction, correlationId, meta } }`
- The HTTP status code must match `problem.status` in the failure body. If status metadata is emitted elsewhere, it must match the same value. Add or update tests when touching problem factories, filters, or interceptors.
- Use the backend problem factory/global exception filter for failures instead of ad hoc response shapes. Do not introduce legacy shapes such as `{ error_code }`, `{ code }`, or custom per-controller error bodies.
- Success responses for JSON controllers must also use the shared envelope directly from backend helpers/interceptors; do not return bare DTOs from some controllers and wrapped DTOs from others.
- Do not apply a global success wrapper to stream/download endpoints unless the endpoint is explicitly JSON-only.

## Web BFF and API client layer

- Keep Next route handlers as BFF/proxy code. They should use shared server helpers for upstream calls, bearer/session handling, query param normalization, result JSON, and payload validation. Do not repeat `fetch(apiBaseUrl...)`, `response.json()`, credential/session cookie guards, or pagination parsing in every route.
- `LCSP_API_BASE_URL` must be read in one shared upstream helper, not repeatedly inside `apps/web/src/app/api` or client modules.
- Shared upstream server logic belongs under `apps/web/src/lib/server` such as `upstream-request.ts`; do not keep Next BFF proxy code in `apps/web/src/lib/api`.
- Shared session/cookie guards, repeated query param normalization, and repeated success/problem forwarding must be centralized in helpers instead of copied across route handlers.
- Client-side API calls must go through the shared `apiRequest` helper so envelope parsing and credential behavior are centralized.
- TanStack Query belongs in `*-queries.ts` hooks. Query hooks orchestrate caching/retries only; envelope parsing stays in `apiRequest`, and domain mapping from `problem.code` to page outcomes stays in domain client modules, using shared outcome constants instead of raw `kind` strings.
- Avoid keeping old `*-client.ts` modules as thin wrappers with duplicated fetch logic. If a domain module remains, it should exist for domain outcome mapping, not to re-implement request plumbing already handled by shared helpers.
- Keep server-only proxy helpers under `apps/web/src/lib/server`, not under `apps/web/src/lib/api`.

## Mock data placement

- All mock payload data must live under `apps/web/src/public/assets/mocks`.
- Type definitions, fixture readers, cookie constants, and mock-mode helpers may live under server/helper folders, but they must not embed mock payload objects that should be JSON assets.
- Do not add mock JSON, fixture payloads, or seed-like web data outside `apps/web/src/public/assets/mocks`.
